# My Collection of Bugs

Here I will save bugs that I have found :bug:. Any sensitive information was covered, but if you consider that something should be deleted, please let me know. These captures are not from work. When I am bored I look for bugs in other websites for fun. :stuck_out_tongue:

### Cosmetic
It is really difficult to read the text in the dropdown, because the font is white and the dropdown color is too light:

The table does not fit into the frame:

### Localization
I use Facebook in Spanish, but I found a message in English:
![Notifications in Facebook](https://github.com/marubatsu/bugs-collection/blob/master/Localization/web_Facebook_notifications.jpg)

This form is in English, but all the error messages are in Portuguese:

![Form2](https://github.com/marubatsu/bugs-collection/blob/master/Localization/web_form_msgs_in_portuguese_2.jpg)

### Usability
This dropdown contains a long list of different values, and it is really difficult to find the correct option because it is not in alphabetical order:

I tried to fill this form using TAB key to move to the next field, but the cursor did not move in order:
