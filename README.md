# :bug: My Bugs Collection :bug:

Here I save evidences of bugs that I have found. Any sensitive information was covered, but if you consider that something should be deleted, please let me know. These captures are not just from work, when I am bored I look for bugs in other websites for fun. :stuck_out_tongue:
